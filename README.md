## Tom Allen

Recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/), and **Junior Full Stack Developer** after a lockdown decision to commit to building a set of technical skills that would let me delve deeper into the systems I work with, understand them and help make them better. Having taken a winding path from science through sales to statistics, I'm a Consummate data-wrangler looking for fertile ground to grow my skillbase into something that can really help people, and a way out of an unintended plant metaphor. Always excited to discover better ways to do things, even more excited to make those things do themselves.

I'm happiest when I can work closely with stakeholders in a project as I'm deeply invested in how my engineering will impact users. I'd love to work for any organisation whose products or services improve peoples lives, and I take pride in working to ensure that the teams I am a part of are happier and more productive than I found them.

## Experience

#### Makers Academy (09/22 to 12/22)
- A highly selective 16-week full stack bootcamp that aims to make industry-ready junior devs.

##### Skills Developed

- **TDD:** From the ground up I've learned to code behaviour-first and keep the debug loop as tight as possible. (RSpec, Jest, Cypress)
- **OOD and SOLID principles:** An emphasis on creating readable code, easily modified.
- **Language-agnostic learning:** Pivoting from Ruby to JavaScript midway through the course we were led through the process of self-learning new languages and frameworks at short notice to use the best tool for the task at hand.
- **Agile:** Developing & practising an Agile workflow on team projects using iterative planning, building a ticketing framework and adjusting team goals to meet changing product specs and team needs. (Trello, Miro)
- **Collaborative engineering:** The course approached nearly 50% pair programming and team projects, and has led me to the realisation that I do all of my best work when I do it outside of my own head.
- **Self-directed learning:** *How* rather than *what* to learn is the hallmark of Makers, and the guidance on goal-setting, progress monitoring and reflection has been the stand-out most valuable lesson in assimilating new tech.
