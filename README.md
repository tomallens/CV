## Tom Allen

Current student at Makers, and therefore a **Very Junior Full Stack Developer**. Consummate data-wrangler looking for fertile ground to grow my skillbase into something that can really help people, and a way out of an unintended plant metaphor. Always excited to find better ways to do things, even more excited to make those things do themselves.
